# Division-Clothing-HTML
Web development This project is a Website for my Clothing Line. This is the HTML/CSS code. I am a YouTuber and plan on making an actual website and clothing for my channel to sell to my viewers (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKgUCbGaYNE65idBgVSmKbQ). In this repository you will see the final mockup of what I would like my website to look like for the home page and some potential pages as well.


The Errors I had:

Element title must not be empty.
Start tag body seen but an element of the same type was already open.
Saw an end tag after body had been closed.
Non-space character after body.
Cannot recover after last error. Any further errors will be ignored.
The border attribute is obsolete. Consider specifying img { border: 0; } in CSS instead. (9)
Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values. (9)

To sum up the errors I needed to added borders and size to my images
Set up the style and create better headings
and reformat some elements
